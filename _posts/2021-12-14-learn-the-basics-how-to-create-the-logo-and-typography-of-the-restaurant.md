You may already know my opinion about the importance of **the logo and typography of the restaurant**. And if you don’t, lemme briefly remind that – I think that it’s an effective tool for restaurants to create, describe and for the audience to identify a brand's identity.

However, it does wonders only when it’s created wisely. But how do restaurants tantalize their logo and choose the right typography? Well, fasten your seatbelt and get ready for a ride – we’ll explore it in a second!

* **Name**. Hard-to-remember or even hard-to-read names should be a no-no. Well, unless that’s the goal that the customers couldn’t pronounce the restaurant’s name. But usually, it’s not the case. Then, it’s best to choose something that would not only sound, but also look attractive. It’s good when it sounds catchy and positive. For instance, IHOP, Sonic, Denny’s, Applebee's, etc. Simplicity is the key here, trust me; however, don’t forget that choosing the right typography can make or break the title, too. A creative way of doing that can catch clients’ attention. 
* **Design**. The design of the logo allows customers to know what to expect from the restaurant. It can be either something as a fast food service, or something really healthy, organic and relaxing. All of this should be reflected in the logo. When creating an image, it’s best to think about the main symbols and associations with the restaurant, its service and food. Restaurants don’t want to make a wrong impression too, so they carefully choose the logo they’ll use. Oh, and almost forgot! Logo and font should match and look put up together. Otherwise, the customer will feel confused and won’t be able to identify the restaurant’s image.
* **Colours**. Every colour has its own meaning, and customers fastly start to associate the colour with your brand. Don’t believe in me? Think about Coca-Cola, Sprite, Heinz, KFC, or Wendy’s. Restaurants focus on creative ways to use colours that would be associated with their style of food, thereby incorporating this proven color scheme into the fonts and artwork.

So, these are the main three things that restaurants look into when creating their logo and typography.

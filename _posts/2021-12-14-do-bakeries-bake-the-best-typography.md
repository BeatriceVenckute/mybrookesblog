*OK, let’s imagine.* You’re going around the city center, enjoying rainy weather, and a good company of friends. And then, you walk through this small ***bakery***. What do you smell?

Sure, fresh baked goods. It smells so good that you can feel the taste of it in your mouth. And what do you see?

Of course, after a second, your eyes stop by all these amazingly-looking reads, cakes, pastries, and other tasty delicacies behind the window. But do you want to know what I see instead of that?

Yeah, you’re totally right – logo and typography it is! Bakeries are always astonishing as they have unique logos and typography elements.

For instance, most of the time, the font that is chosen for a bakery place will look like it’s written by hand. Bakeries usually use roundish-looking letters; they don’t avoid cursive. It looks neat and even subtle.

This choice of fonts creates a sense of authenticity; in addition, it creates a cozy and familiar atmosphere. It’s pretty important as it makes visitors feel that the goods they’re planning to buy are natural, and delicious as homemade ones. And that’s what we all want, right?

The other thing that is important to notice – the dominant colours of the typography. For that, I have a task. Open “Google images” and write “Bakery typography” into the searching field. Now, check some of the examples and answer the question: what do these pictures have in common?

*BINGO*! Most of the fonts use white, black, brown, yellow colours. These colours are associated with the bakery goods themselves.

It makes me come to a conclusion: bakeries might bake a good typography. But is it the best? Well, I guess that depends on the personal taste. Personally, I find it admirable how bakeries create this mix of authenticity and modernism. However, I don’t think it’s the best, as it doesn’t stand out or blow my mind – it just traditionally reflects the place and the products it offers.

You love to eat? I love to talk about the typography of the places you eat in. We already have something in common, don't we? :) \
\
I created this blog to explore the way texts look in different spots you eat in. Cafés, buffets, fast food places, or fancy restaurants – they all have their own unique style of presenting themselves. Various fonts, colours, and even sizes can portray the atmosphere of the place you're planning to go to. And you don't even have to come inside to find it out!\

Want to learn this superpower? Follow the blog. Let's dive into the pool of typography together!\

This page is where you write something about yourself. You can add pictures so that people know where you come from or where you live.

This file is an example of a page in Jekyll, that automatically shows up in the header navigation, you can delete or modify this file freely.

This file is saved inside the *pages* folder and is saved as *about.md* . Any file in this folder (as long as it has  the YAML header) will automatically show up as a link in the header bar.

You should use **markdown**to write this text and this will automatically be converted to `HTML`.
